## Requirements

Before using this script, ensure you have the following requirements in place:

- Python 3.x
- The `replicate` library
- An image file for which you want to generate a text prompt (referenced as "path to file" in the code)
- An API key or access to the Img2Prompt API, which you can obtain from [Replicate](https://replicate.com)

## Getting Started
